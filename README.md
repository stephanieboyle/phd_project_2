# PhD Project 2 : Theta and Alpha Power are modulated by Sensory Reliability Early during Audio-visual Integration.

<br>

Oscillations have been found in a variety of multisensory tasks, and are thought
to be a fundamental process by which the brain combines information across the
senses. However, it has yet to be investigated whether oscillatory power is
modulated by the reliability of sensory information. Here we used a timefrequency approach to investigate whether the oscillatory power underlying
auditory signals was modulated by changes in visual reliability during audiovisual integration. Additionally, we examined whether any changes in oscillatory 
28
power occurred at the same time as changes in perceptual weighting. Our results
revealed that auditory power during audio-visual conditions is modulated by
visual reliability early during the perceptual process. Specifically, we found
significantly lower theta power and higher alpha power during audio-visual
conditions where the visual reliability was low, relative to conditions where
visual reliability was high. These modulations in power occurred early in the trial
from stimulus onset to 150 ms, and from 252 ms to 300 ms for theta and alpha
respectively, over fronto-central sites. Together these results suggest a role of
theta and alpha in sensory reweighting, occurring at an early stage during audiovisual integration.
